These are patches adding support for the Rainforest algorithm to existing products :

* smhasher-rf256.diff : for SMHasher, to validate the algorithm's robustness
* cpuminer-multi-39fff.diff : this is for commit 39fff of this popular CPU miner
  => you have to manually copy files rf_aes2r.c, rf_crc32.c, rfv2.h, rfv2_core.c,
     and rfv2_cpuminer.c verbatim into the "algo" directory
* sgminer-gm-add-rainforest+precalc.diff : this is for the latest version of this GPU miner
* yiimp-rainforest.diff : this is for the latest version of this popular server

Support for Android wallets would be appreciated.
